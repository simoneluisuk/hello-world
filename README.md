Fold mountains occur at destrcutive plate margins
First convection currents drive the Oceanic and Continental crust to converge.
Then the denser but thinner OCeanic crust subducts under the Continental crust.
Due to the temperature of the mantle, a part of the Oceanic crust melts and increase of lava is prodcued.
Therefore the lava rises as there is more in a fixed area and errupts from a composite cone.
As the plates converge the material on landn gets crumpled and compresses causing fold mountians 
As a result of the fold mountains an Oceanic trench forms in the area where the Oceanic crust subducted.
